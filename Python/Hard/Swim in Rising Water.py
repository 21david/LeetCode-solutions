"""  
Binary search approach, thought of this in maybe ~5 minutes, spent ~25 thinking of a better
approach but didn't find.

Find the max value in the array (or use n^2).
Find half of that, do flood fill on (0,0) to see if it can reach bottom-right
with only cells â‰¤ that value. If not, increase. If it can, decrease until it can't.
Find the exact smallest value that allows the goal using BS.

TC = O(N^2 log N^2)
SC = O(N^2) if using DFS.
    Can be optimized to O(N) with BFS I think

With the low constraints, I think a brute force would work:
for each t from 0 - n^2, do a flood fill to check if the bottom right can be reached.
TC = O(N^3)
