/*
Initialize a counter variable to store the profit.

Upon start, continue iterating until a minimum is reached. (meaning, until the next number is greater than current number)
Buy that minimum, then continue iterating until a maximum is reached. 
When a maximum is reached, sell it, and continue iterating until a minimum is reached.
Repeat this for the whole array. Stop when 'i' reaches the end of the array.

Return the profit made.
