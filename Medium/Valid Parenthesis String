/*
Somewhat builds off of an approach to a regular "Valid Parenthesis String" problem without the * rule.
The regular approach:
Simply having a counter variable that increases by 1 with a '(' and decreases by 1 with a ')'
If at the end, this number is not 0, or if it ever has the value -1, the parenthesis are not valid.

This approach considers a minimum counter, sort of representing the case where all *s are ')'
and a maximum counter, representing the case where all *s are '('. Any number in between these two
represent mixed cases where the *s represent '(', ')', and empty strings. If at the end, either value 
is 0, then the string can be made valid with replacements to *s. Note, however, that the maximum
value can never have a value of -1, so it returns false if it ever does.
