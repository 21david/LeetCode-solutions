        I think there are only 3 cases. If the pattern fits one of these 3 cases,
        the answer is true. If not, the answer is false.
        
        Case 1) The robot ends up at (0,0) after the first iteration
        Case 2) It ends up at (0,0) after 2 iterations
        Case 3) It ends up at (0,0) after 4 iterations
        
        I could try running the instructions, keeping track of the position after
        1, 2, and 4 iterations. If it reaches (0,0) after any of the iterations, 
        return true right away. If it never reaches (0,0), return false.
