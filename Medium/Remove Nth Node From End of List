        Approach after seeing optimal solution: 
        We can iterate to the (n+1)th node using a pointer, then, we can
        set another pointer to the beginning and iterate both
        pointers at the same speed until the second pointer
        reaches the null at the end. They will have a gap of
        n+1 in between, and this gap will put our leftmost pointer
        on the node right before the one we want to remove.
        Then, we just remove the node and return the head.
        Time complexity: O(N) (one pass through the linked list)
        Space complexity: O(1), no extra memory is used except pointers

            n--;
        }
        
        // iterate that pointer until it reaches the end
        // and iterate another pointer starting from the beginning
        // this will put pointer1 right behind the node we want to remove
