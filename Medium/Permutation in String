        Approach, O(s1 + s2) I think:
        -Create an array of length 26 that counts the frequency of each letter in s1 (a multiset)
        -Create a temporary array of length 26, to be used to find possible permutations
        -Also create a HashSet containing all the characters in s1, so we can check if a letter 
        is in s1 with O(1) time
        -Create a count variable
        -Iterate through each character in s2, check if each letter is in the HashSet
          -if it is, increment count by 1, and increment the frequency of that letter in the temporary array
          -if not, set count to 0
        -if count reaches the size of s1, then we have a potential "candidate" that could be a 
         permutation of s1. So we compare the multiset of s1 with this multiset. If they are the
         exact same, then we found a permutation, so we can return true.
        -if count gets bigger than the size of s1, then we need to remove whatever is at the "tail" of the current list of characters we have. We need a tail variable (int) for this, to store the index of the "tail"
        -if we reach the end of the array and never found a permutation, then we return false
