        We can go through the list of words, comparing each word with the next word, until we
        reach the end of the list. As we compare, if two words are not lexicographically in order,
        we return false. If all pairs of words return true (if they are in order), then we return 
        true at the end.
        We need a method that takes in two strings and checks that they are in order.
        To do this, we iterate through both words, comparing the letters one by one.
        If the letters are equal or if they are in order, we move to the next.
        If they are out of order, we return false for the whole algorithm right away.
        I think we can use a HashMap that maps letters to their position in the alphabet
        to help us check if two words are in order in the method we will write.
